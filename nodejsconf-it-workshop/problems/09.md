# LevelDB

So far our chat server has only been receiving messages when other people are
online. Wouldn't it be nice if we could add persistence to our p2p chat system
so you would receive messages from your friends even though you were online when
they sent it?

Luckily there is a really great small database for node called LevelDB. The best
thing about LevelDB is that it does very few things! It is a small key value store
that runs inside your process and persists to disk.

You can use by installing the level module from npm

```
npm install level
```

You can read the documentation for leveldb here, https://github.com/level/levelup

## Tasks

To complete this excercise you should make a two new programs.

The first one, `put.js` should put the value `world` into the key `hello` and store it
in a leveldb called `test.db`.

The other one, `get.js` should get the key `hello` from the same leveldb and print it out

## Tips

To create a new levelup do `var db = level(dbName)`, to put a key/value pair you can do
`db.put(key, value, callback)` and to get a key you can do `db.get(key, callback)`

## Testing

To test if your solution is corrent first run

```
node put.js
```

and then

```
node get.js
```

If you inserted the value correctly `get.js` should print out `world`
